# Project Nutshell

A social platform where members get at most one post per week in a specific format.

## Repository protocols

- Never push directly to the `master` branch
- All merges are done through pull-requests
- Merges are never done by the code author
- Plain text file formats are strongly preferred ( `markdown` > `docx`, `svg` > `ai`)

Folder structure:

```shell
- <root>
    Nothing but the readme

-- /documents/
    Operational documents

-- /app/
    Appliation-specific code

-- /assets/
    Images, designs etc
```
